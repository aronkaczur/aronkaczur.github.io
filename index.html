      The series takes place primarily in the benthic underwater city of Bikini Bottom located in the Pacific Ocean
      beneath the real-life coral reef known as Bikini Atoll.[8][9][10][b] Its citizens are mostly multicolored fish
      who live in buildings made from ship funnels and use "boatmobiles", amalgamations of cars and boats, as a mode
      of transportation. Recurring locations within Bikini Bottom include the neighboring houses of SpongeBob,
      Patrick, and Squidward; two competing restaurants, the Krusty Krab and the Chum Bucket; Mrs. Puff's Boating
      School, which includes a driving course and a sunken lighthouse; the Treedome, an oxygenated glass enclosure
      where Sandy lives; Shady Shoals Rest Home; a seagrass meadow called Jellyfish Fields; and Goo Lagoon, a
      subaqueous brine pool that is a popular beach hangout.[12]
